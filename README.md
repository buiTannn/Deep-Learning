# Deep Learning with PyTorch

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository! This project is a personal collection of experiments, tutorials, and implementations using **PyTorch**. It focuses on building a strong foundation in deep learning and progressively explores more advanced models such as **ResNet** and **YOLO**.

## Topics Covered

This repository will include:

### PyTorch Basics
- Tensors and operations
- Automatic differentiation (`autograd`)
- Building custom datasets and dataloaders
- Training and evaluation loops
- Loss functions and optimizers
- Learning rate schedulers

### Image Classification
- Using pretrained models (e.g. ResNet18, ResNet50)
- Fine-tuning and transfer learning
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

### Object Detection
- Training YOLOv8 models
- Annotating and preparing datasets
- Evaluating detection results
